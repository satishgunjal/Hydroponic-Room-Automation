# Hydroponic-Room-Automation

## What is Hydropnic?
- Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil by instead using water
- Hydroponic room is any room where hydroponic fodder is grown in controlled condition
- Hydroponic fodder is a cultivation of nutritious green fodder (grass) in water medium with added nutrients in it
- We can use seeds like Barley, Oats, Maize, Wheat, Jowar, Bajra to grow hydroponic fodder

## Why Automation is required?
- Since we are not using soil medium, to grow healthy fodder we have to control below important parameters
  Temperature
  Humidity
  Watering interval and time
  Ventilation
  Air circulation
- We cant maintain all above paramaters by mannual labour
- Using Raspberry pi and few sensors we can easily automate the whole process.

## List of material
- Raspberry Pi
- 5V 10A 8 channel relay (For resistive load)
- 5V 30A single relay baord (For indusctive load)
- Adafruit  DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor
- Optocoupler EL817
- USB hub
- 0.5 HP submersible water pump
- Four 60W exhaust fans
- Two 50W ventilation fan
- One 130W Air Cooler ( A.C is better than cooler)
- UPS (To save RPi from electricity outage and for safe shutdown)
  I have design my ouwn UPS but there are many solutions available in market

# Equipments To Control
1. One 0.5 HP submersible water pump
2. Four 60W exhaust fans
3. Two 50W ventilation fan
4. One 130W Air Cooler
